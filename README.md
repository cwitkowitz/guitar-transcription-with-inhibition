# TODO

0. Make sure to download DadaGP and GuitarSet (and correctly specify their paths)
1. Generate JAMS files from GuitarPro data (symbolic tablature)
2. Create matrix of inhibition weights from symbolic tablature

Options
* Analyze/visualize matrix weights
* Run 6-fold cross-validation experiments
* Train a model for realtime processing
* Evaluate a model on a dataset (e.g. GuitarSet)
* Run inference (offline/online/realtime) on a specific track
* Run inference on audio from microphone
